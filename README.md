# Overview:
<br>
Given 39 features of a water well, predict a well's condition/functionality. The possible values for well functionality are as follows:
- Functional
- Functional, Needs repairs
- Non-functional
The [data](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/data/) consisted of close to 60,000 water wells in Tanzania, recorded by GeoData Consultants Ltd.





# Goals:
<br>
- Identify the features that correlate most with water well functionality.
- Create a Logistic Regression model that predicts a water well's condition with maximum accuracy.
